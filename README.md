--GEO RUNNER--

Creator: Joseph Cheatham

Description:
GEO RUNNER is a 2D endless sidescrolling running game
featuring geometric sprites. It is a simple showcase of
coding basic 2D physics behavior and UI design in Unity.

The goal is to make it as far as possible without hitting
a spike. Spikes spawn at random intervals. They speed up
the longer the player is running, increasing the difficulty
as time goes on.

Controls:
Jump - Space Bar
Pause / Unpause - Escape
